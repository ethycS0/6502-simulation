# 6502 Microprocessor Simulation

## Project Overview

This project is a self-learning initiative to simulate the 6502 microprocessor using C++. The 6502 microprocessor, known for its role in the NES and other classic systems, serves as an ideal starting point for understanding low-level simulation and emulator development.

### Motivation

As a fan of _Elden Ring_ and _Sekiro_, I wanted to play _Bloodborne_ on my PC, but it is not officially available. During my search, I discovered [ShadPS4](https://github.com/ShadPS4), an ambitious PS4 emulator in development aimed at running games like _Bloodborne_. Inspired by the idea of contributing to such a project but realizing I lacked the foundational knowledge in emulator development, I decided to create this project to dip my toes into simulation and emulation of a CPU.

### Features

- **6502 CPU Simulation:** A general-purpose 6502 CPU implementation.
- **Instruction Execution:** Execute and test basic 6502 instructions in a simulated environment.

## Why 6502?

The 6502 microprocessor is both simple and iconic, making it a perfect starting point for emulator enthusiasts. Its role in the NES and other vintage systems makes it an essential stepping stone for understanding more complex systems.
