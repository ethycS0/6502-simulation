# 6502 Microprocessor Simulation

## Project Overview

This project is a self-learning initiative to simulate the 6502 microprocessor using C++. The 6502 microprocessor, known for its role in the NES and other classic systems, serves as an ideal starting point for understanding low-level simulation and emulator development. While this project currently focuses on simulating the 6502, the long-term goal is to expand it into a full NES emulator.

### Current State
- **6502 Simulation:** Implemented basic functionalities of the 6502 microprocessor.
- **Visualization:** Using the [olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine) to display registers and illustrate how the simulator works.
- **Future Plans:** Transitioning the visualization to SDL for more flexibility and better integration with future goals.

### Motivation

As a fan of *Elden Ring* and *Sekiro*, I wanted to play *Bloodborne* on my PC, but it is not officially available. During my search, I discovered [ShadPS4](https://github.com/ShadPS4), an ambitious PS4 emulator in development aimed at running games like *Bloodborne*. Inspired by the idea of contributing to such a project but realizing I lacked the foundational knowledge in emulator development, I decided to create this project to dip my toes into simulation and emulation.

### Features
- **6502 CPU Simulation:** A general-purpose 6502 CPU implementation.
- **Register Display:** View the internal registers in real-time using the olcPixelGameEngine.
- **Instruction Execution:** Execute and test basic 6502 instructions in a simulated environment.

### Future Goals
1. Expand the 6502 simulator into a complete NES emulator.
2. Transition from olcPixelGameEngine to SDL for enhanced UI capabilities.
3. Learn advanced emulator development concepts to contribute to larger projects.

## Why 6502?

The 6502 microprocessor is both simple and iconic, making it a perfect starting point for emulator enthusiasts. Its role in the NES and other vintage systems makes it an essential stepping stone for understanding more complex systems.
